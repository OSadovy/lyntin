    Neil's Pub is a small mini-mud capable of allowing multiple
    people to log on and do basic things.  It allows us to test
    various things without connecting to a real mud and possibly
    messing things up.  It's also another reason why Lyntin is
    so cool--you get your own mini-mud along with your mud 
    client!
