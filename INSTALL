SUMMARY
=======

This document holds installation instructions for various operating
systems as well as a series of general setup instructions for getting
started with Lyntin.


UNIX/LINUX
==========

Requirements:

1. Python 2.2 (with Tkinter if you want to use the tkui) 
   http://www.python.org/
2. tar
3. gzip


Steps:

1. Make sure you have at least Python 2.2--you can do this by 
   running "python" and seeing what version it says it is.  If 
   you don't have Python 2.2 or later installed, Lyntin won't work.
2. Download the version of Lyntin you're looking for (below) 
3. Untar the client into ~/lyntin or something along those lines
4. Run "python lyntin.py"

lyntin.py takes a series of options.  For a list of options 
and explanations, run:

   python lyntin.py --help



WINDOWS
=======

Requirements:

1. Python 2.2 http://www.python.org/
2. Winzip or some other pkzip extracting program


Steps:

1. Make sure you have at least Python 2.2
2. Unzip the client into "c:\lyntin"
3. Right click on lyntin.py and select "Create Shortcut"
4. Then right click on the new shortcut and select "Properties"
5. There are many versions of Windows and I think shortcut properties
   differ between them.  On Win2k, I have my shortcut set up like this:

   Target:    {path_to_python}\pythonw.exe c:\lyntin\lyntin.py --ui tk
   Start in:  c:\lyntin
   Run:       Normal window

Note: {path_to_python} needs to be replaced with the actual path to
"pythonw.exe".  So if "pythonw.exe" is in "c:\python22\bin"
then the Target would be:

   c:\python22\bin\pythonw.exe c:\lyntin\lyntin.py --ui tk


Good luck!
