SUMMARY
=======

This document holds installation instructions for various operating
systems as well as a series of general setup instructions for getting
started with Lyntin.

There are separate instructions for UNIX/LINUX and for WINDOWS.  Read
the appropriate one for your system.


UNIX/LINUX
==========

Requirements:

1. Python 2.2 (with Tkinter if you want to use the tkui) 
   http://www.python.org/
2. tar
3. gzip


Steps:

Untar and unzip the client.  Then run:

   python setup.py install

That'll install the "runlyntin" script into /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin 
depending on how you have Python installed.  

Lyntin takes both command-line options as well as a config file.  A 
sample config file looks like this:

%<------------------
[Lyntin]
ui:        text
datadir:   /home/willg/ltd40
moduledir: /home/willg/ltd40
readfile:  http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/3krc
%<------------------

To start Lyntin with the config file do this:

   runlyntin -c /path/to/config.ini

Lyntin takes a series of command-line options.  For a list of basic 
options and explanations, run:

   runlyntin --help


WINDOWS
=======

Requirements:

1. Python 2.2 http://www.python.org/


Steps:

1. Make sure you have at least Python 2.2.
2. Run the installer which will install the Lyntin libraries and
   standard modules into the site-packages directory of your
   Python installation.
3. Download the startup script runlyntin.pyw from the website.
4. Adjust the boot settings in the startup script to suit your 
   needs.
