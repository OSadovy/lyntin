SUMMARY
=======

This document holds installation instructions for various operating
systems as well as a series of general setup instructions for getting
started with Lyntin.


UNIX/LINUX
==========

Requirements:

1. Python 2.2 (with Tkinter if you want to use the tkui) 
   http://www.python.org/
2. tar
3. gzip


Steps:

Untar and unzip the client.  Then run "python setup.py install".  That'll
install a "lyntin" and a "lyntintk" scripts into /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
depending on how you have Python installed.  Those two scripts will start
Lyntin.

Lyntin takes a series of command-line options.  For a list of options 
and explanations, run:

   lyntin --help

The lyntintk script is exactly like running:

   lyntin --ui tk


WINDOWS
=======

Requirements:

1. Python 2.2 http://www.python.org/
2. Winzip or some other pkzip extracting program


Steps:

1. Make sure you have at least Python 2.2
2. Unzip the client into "c:\lyntin"
3. Right click on lyntin.py and select "Create Shortcut"
4. Then right click on the new shortcut and select "Properties"
5. There are many versions of Windows and I think shortcut properties
   differ between them.  On Win2k, I have my shortcut set up like this:

   Target:    {path_to_python}\pythonw.exe c:\lyntin\lyntin.py --ui tk
   Start in:  c:\lyntin
   Run:       Normal window

Note: {path_to_python} needs to be replaced with the actual path to
"pythonw.exe".  So if "pythonw.exe" is in "c:\python22\bin"
then the Target would be:

   c:\python22\bin\pythonw.exe c:\lyntin\lyntin.py --ui tk


Good luck!
